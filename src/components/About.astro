          I'm <span class="font-bold text-gray-900">Victor Diaz Gessner</span>, a mechanical engineer graduating from Northeastern University in May 2026 with a B.S. and a 3.7 GPA. I thrive on solving complex design challenges and bringing products from concept to market. My passion for understanding how things work has led me into mechanical design, where I've worked on optimizing fluid systems, prototyping, testing, and making designs manufacturable.

        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          At <span class="font-bold text-gray-900">SharkNinja</span>, I worked directly with cross-functional teams to build rapid prototypes by developing designs and Python algorithms that decreased prototyping iterations by 75%, letting us test concepts faster and catch design issues early. At <span class="font-bold text-gray-900">Johnson & Johnson MedTech</span>, I tackled production bottlenecks head-on through hands-on problem solving and data-driven analysis. By designing, testing, and implementing 150+ fixtures and line improvements, I increased manufacturing yield by 23%.

          My research background includes investigating neutron shielding ceramics for <span class="font-bold text-gray-900">RTX Raytheon</span>, where I connected material properties at the microscale to real-world performance. This work reinforced my belief that great mechanical designs are generated when the underlying mechanisms are understood.

        <p class="text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed text-gray-600">
          I've always challenged myself with the most technically demanding projects, whether for aerospace systems or emerging technology design. My interests vary widely from Formula 1 and financial education to machine learning and deep neural networks—I'm always trying to learn new skills and frameworks. The projects below demonstrate how I approach complex mechanical problems by aligning the right people and delivering solutions that work in the real world.
