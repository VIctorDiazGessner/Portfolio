  aboutMe:
    "I am a mechanical engineer with a B.S., from Northeastern University. I thrive on solving complex design challenges and bringing products from concepts to market. My passion for understanding how things work has led me into mechanical design. I have worked on prototyping, testing, making designs manufacturable, optimizing systems, and large scale data analysis. I have always challenged myself with the most technically demanding projects, whether it is for aerospace systems or emerging technology design. The projects below demonstrate how I approach complex mechanical problems by aligning the right people and delivering solutions that work in the real world. ",

      name: "Flow Rate Algorithm",
      description:
        "Cut prototyping costs by 75% by self-teaching Python to solve a fluid mechanics challenge that stumped 12 physical iterations - developing an algorithm that calculates perfect flow distribution across manifold outlets using Reynolds numbers, pressure drop analysis, and discharge coefficients. Instead of continuing expensive trial-and-error machining, I built a computational tool that accounts for real-world variables like material roughness and pressure losses, achieving the precise flow uniformity that manual design couldn't match. This reusable algorithm now permanently accelerates our manifold design process, demonstrating how combining mechanical engineering principles with programming creates breakthrough solutions.",

       "Designed and prototyped a mechanically-operated transforming desk that solves the urban space crisis reducing footprint by 70% when stored while providing full workspace functionality through an elegant hand-crank system. Led a six-person team while self-teaching FEA to validate the rack-and-pinion mechanism, performing advanced structural calculations to ensure the freestanding design could support real-world loads without wall mounting. Delivered a fully functional 3D prototype and comprehensive engineering analysis proving this renter-friendly solution could revolutionize small-space living for the 75% of Americans in apartments.",
